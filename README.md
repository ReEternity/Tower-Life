# Tower-Life
This project is inspired by your average 100 floor towers cliche in novels/manhwa/manga

Welcome to tower life, this project is the symbol of my imagination, it has Gacha, text RPG, and skills so far. It is still working in progress but playable to an extent. Just head to the Tower_Life_client class and run the main method.
